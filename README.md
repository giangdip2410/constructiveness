### Constructiveness
==============================

Identifying constructive language

News organizations enable online commenting with the goal of increasing user engagement and enhancing the quality of news and information. Unfortunately, online commenting platforms are often used as a place to vent anger, frustration, and express hatred, in general or towards specific groups. While there is a clear value in including reader comments, news organizations find themselves having to sift through and organize comments to ensure that commenters exchange views, opinions, and insights in a respectful and constructive manner, and to keep the discussion relevant to the issues discussed in the article. The goal of this project is to promote meaningful and constructive discussion online. Accordingly, we have developed computational methods to identify constructive comments.
