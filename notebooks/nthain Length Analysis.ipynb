I divorced when my kids were 12 and 15 and both my ex and I continued to pour our energy into our children who are both highly successful . I have a friend who chose to have a baby at 40 through IVF because she finally accepted she would n't find the one ' . Her child is living with his Mum and his grandmother and attending private school . He will shine . My own parents had 7 children in the days when Catholicism existed - they never had the money to afford another but somehow they did and all 7 succeeded ( based solely on social capital and virtually none of the financial kind ) . It 's not just marriage versus non-marriage - it 's how you learned to raise a child at your parents ' knee ( s ) . So classes for these women who do n't even know what a good and stable childhood would be plus universal daycare with highly qualified carers would help . It 's a big issue and it will cost a lot of money to address .   \n",

The people who read this paper are such rabid Harper haters that a discussion of his strengths and weaknesses drives them in to a rage , because he has no strengths and is , of course , Evil Incarnate . I do n't know how many times he 's been compared to Hitler in these boards , but obviously once is to many for any sane observer of the Canadian political scene . In the U.S , the right hates with passion . In Canada , sadly its the left .   \n",

Usually , they are extremely anti-authority . That 's their mindset . They resent authority , yet want to tell everyone else to think like them . If you asked most prisoners in penitentiary , most would have the save views as libertarians . Most of them are n't as intelligent as Flanagan . So , to them a victimless crime would be rationalized as such because the owner had insurance . Just like pornography is considered a victimless crime by Flanagan and his demented defenders . It is n't so much what he said and parsing that to death . It 's what he thinks on the subject . The offending remarks are no doubt the very tip of the iceberg . Harper and Smith likely know exactly what his view are on any number of subjects . The thing that got him into so trouble with Harper and Smith is the fact that he let it slip , not that what he believes .   \n",

That is lazy and too easy . Harper 's years as Prime Minster is the reason he is going down in flames . He has nothing compelling to offer and at least the Liberal and the NDP have change to offer . People in Canada are just tired of Harper and the collapsing Canadian economy is likely the biggest reason for the drop in Conservative support .   \n",

It misses the point a bit . Something common to both British and French civilization is the experience of the Enlightenment . This was a successful struggle to provide freedom from religion . As a result of keeping religion at arms length , and in private , these societies have flourished , as well as those following their example . As long as no children are hurt , nobody cares what people wear or how they worship in their own home or at their own temple , church or mosque . And nobody should care . But when people want to hold a publicly funded position , it causes offence to many people when they manifest their private business on public time .   \n",

       "31    Both make strong cases , but I agree with Mulcair . Yes ISIS needs to be taken out militarily , but it should be other Middle Eastern countries who do this , not the West . We can supply training to those groups , but we should not be involved combat wise . The reality is in the Middle East , the West is widely despised and military action will just make recruits to ISIS easier . Baird is right that the coalition is broad and received near unanimous support in most European countries including from left wing parties . But so what ? We are not Europe or the US and considering the bloody histories of those two areas in imperialism and colonialism I do n't think we should rush to join them in any war . I am not against war , but war should be for defensive purposes not offensive . ISIS may have listed Canada as a target , but with better immigration controls in place we can easily stop them from even reaching our shores .

       "34    I think that climate change is real and largely caused by humans , and have thought so for decades . I also agree with everything in Wente 's article . Much of the discussion on the subject is driven by or based on personal identity , personal psychology , partisan politics , ideology held with religious certainty , and any number of silly things . There are few places at which these phenomena can be seen better than these forums . I think that we are doomed on this file because of ( a ) the gigantic forces creating greenhouse gases and the rate of that production , and ( b ) the rather half-witted discussions around the subject . Speaking of half-wits , CHCH TV ( Hamilton ) did a news item last night on the Alberta oil sands , and advised us that the tar sands are one of the main sources driving global warming .

This is not because I have anything overly significant ' against religion , but I feel that when people are able to sends their kids to good ' schools what does that leave for everyone else ?

       "43    since taking power , the NDP government has often been more Stephen Harper than Justin Trudeau , curtailing reporters ’ access and ending press conferences when it didn ’ t like what was being asked . What began as petty has evolved into something far worse . incredibly , the Globe that endorsed Harper - who would n't even meet with the media most days and excluded many media reps from the few Q & As he conducted - actually says Trudeau is more Harper than Harper . The irony could n't be thicker . It 's also a flat out lie . Trudeau has made himself and his cabinet refreshingly accessible to the press and the public . Now I do n't know what 's going on with the Alberta legislature - other than the fact the Rebel Media crew have at least one wannabe assassin in their ranks .

If the Liberals had stuck with a hard working politician like Bob Rae rather than the unproven son of a former populous PM , I believe their rating in the polls today would be in over 50 % based on the Conservatives past record and the NDP 's future promises . Instead , we have 3 main parties running neck and neck all all claiming entitlement to the middle ground of Canadian voters . My MP polls me 3 times a month to find out where that middle ground is .

On a intellectual level , this is just silly as we ca n't know how another regime will function and the Harper PMO has been particularly toxic . Further , politicians are n't actually powerless here . They can act collectively to defy their party should they believe it to be abusive of power . Just because feckless CPC MPs have refused to stand up to the big boss does n't mean that MPs representing other parties need be similarly supine .   \n",

First , BC has the lowest income tax only for those making under $ 75kyr . Anyone above that is better off in Alberta . BC 's GDP did not outperform the rest of Canada since 2008 . It outperformed Provinces not named Alberta and Saskatchewan and it 's forecasted growth to 2015 is no better than Manitoba . To attribute BC 's growth to a carbon tax instead of the obvious fact that BC is simply a Province with natural resources is disingenuous to say the least .   \n",

The recommendation was one of the chief findings in the wake of the scandal which found that schools in Birmingham had been taken over by Islamists . The review found that one of the school had been funding a Madrassa from its own budget , while at another Muslim children had been taken on trips to Saudi Arabia . A third school regularly broadcast a call to Muslim prayer over the school ’ s loudspeaker in the playground while another school taught in biology that “ evolution is not what we believe ” source : Daily Telegraph June 9 2014   \n",

They have established equal pay for equal work , given employees workplace and retirement benefits , given employees contracts , established harrassment policies , stopped nepotism et employers , government or private , can now roll back the calendar and exploit people . Pay them a wage that allows them to just get by , fire them at whim and bring in replacement workers for sketchy reasons , but the one thats most cryptic is they can pay low wages without benefits and spread windfall profits to a select few . Unions occassionally are obtuse , but look where they have taken the average worker . People rally against government workers and teachers because their unions have brought them to a good place and many people do not have the security and benefits that unions provide .

The Catholic system is by far the better of the two school systems - it teaches and promotes respect and dignity . Go into many public schools in Ontario and they are dumps . Not because the Catholic board is stealing ' tax $ $ from the public boards . But because they are better managed and in fact receive LESS $ $ than the public boards . If anything , it 's the public boards who need to pull up their boot straps , manage their schools better .

This is very similar to the Democrats ( status quo ) vs the Republicans ( build the wall and monitor muslim immigration ) .   \n",
       "2396  You know , I love this province and I think it would be a shame for us to adopt harper style governance or revert to the hardships of the Harris days . Notwithstanding Hudak 's creative math skills , the guy has no proven leadership skills . I have always considered the Globe and Mail to be pro-business , but even this weak and pathetic endorsement of Hudak is going too far . It is disappointing to see nary a mention of the NDP as a viable option and to see the Globe and Mail repeating the anti-union rhetoric that has plagued the United States . I would expect at least a pretense of fairness and balance in your editorials . Conscientious Ontarians need to be considering either the NDP or the Liberals , but must also be mindful of the dangers of splitting the vote and unwarily letting the Conservatives sneak through the middle . As bad as the Liberals have been under McGuinty , I still think that the current premier is deserving of a chance to correct their errors and prove her wort...   \n",
